# 3. Two-Way Analysis with marital status
#######
# In two separate analyses we will explore two research questions
# with the Beck Depression Inventory outcome.
# 1. Is there any evidence of a differential effect of treatment 
#    on BDI at EOT based on being married?
# 2. Is there any evidence that the treatment is differentially 
#    effective on BDI at EOT based on working status?

# For the first question (1), we will run the two-way between-
# subjects ANOVA, regressing bdi_EOT on the interaction between
# treamtent condition (ConditionF) and the married indicator 
# (marriedF).

# Begin by testing assumptions for the two-way between-subjects
# ANOVA, which are identical to the one-way between-subjects 
# ANOVA. Here, we have two factors, condition and married. They
# each have 3 and 2 levels, respectively, so the design has a 
# total of 3*2 = 6 groups. 


# CONSTANT VARIANCE ASSUMPTION
# The assumption of constant residual 
# variance implies that the variance of the outcome variable will
# be identical in each group.

# 1. Begin with boxplots.
par(mar = c(11, 4, 4, 2) + .1)
boxplot(bdi_EOT ~ ConditionF:collegeF, data = dat2, las = 2, 
        xlab = "", main = "Boxplots of BDI at EOT by Group",
        ylab = "BDI Score")
# 2. Next, calculate sample variances and rule of thumb ratio.
by(data = dat2$bdi_EOT, 
   INDICES = list(dat2$ConditionF, dat2$collegeF),
   FUN = var, na.rm = TRUE)
#    Need group sample sizes for this as well.
table(dat2$collegeF, dat2$ConditionF)
# Largest to smallest ratio:
(67/20)*(157.74/29.34) # 18.01 is large # exceeds 4
# 3. Run a statistical test of the null hypothesis of equal 
#    group variances (e.g., Levene's test).
library(car)
leveneTest(bdi_EOT ~ ConditionF*collegeF, data = dat2) #Levene's not significant 
# Assumption for Homogeineity of Variance is not violated

# The WL control group sample sizes are about half as large
# as the other groups, and the variances associated with the 
# WL control groups are larger. This is an "inverse pairing" 
# (i.e., groups with smaller sample sizes have larger variances), 
# which can lead to over-confidence in results. That is, p-values
# will tend to be smaller (i.e., more significant) than they 
# would have been had the assumption been satisfied. Although we
# will carry on here to demonstrate the use and application of two-
# way between-subjects ANOVA, we should be careful to not interpret
# the resultant p-values at face value.

# we will examine the QQplot after fitting the full regression model.
